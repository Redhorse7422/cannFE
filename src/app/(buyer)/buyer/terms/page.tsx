                against any Losses arising out of or relating to any third-party claim concerning: (a) your or any End
                Users’ use of the Services (including any activities under your Aura Well USA account and use by your
                employees and personnel); (b) breach of this Agreement or violation of applicable law by you, End Users
                or Your Content; or (c) a dispute between you and any End User. You will reimburse us for reasonable
                attorneys’ fees, as well as our employees’ and contractors’ time and materials spent responding to any

                <strong>7.2 Intellectual Property.</strong> (a) Subject to the limitations in this Section 7, Aura Well
                USA will defend you and your employees, officers, and directors against any third-party claim alleging
                that the Services infringe or misappropriate that third party’s intellectual property rights, and will
                pay the amount of any adverse final judgment or settlement. (b) Subject to the limitations in this
                Section 7, you will defend CE, its affiliates, and their respective employees, officers, and directors
                against any third-party claim alleging that any of Your Content infringes or misappropriates that third
                party’s intellectual property rights, and will pay the amount of any adverse final judgment or
                settlement. (c) Neither party will have obligations or liability under this Section 7.2 arising from
                infringement by combinations of the Services or Your Content, as applicable, with any other product,
                service, software, data, content or method. In addition, Aura Well USA will have no obligations or
                liability arising from your or any End User’s use of the Services after Aura Well USA has notified you
                to discontinue such use. The remedies provided in this Section 7.2 are the sole and exclusive remedies
                for any third-party claims of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights by the
                Services or by Your Content. (d) For any claim covered by Section 7.2(a), Aura Well USA will, at its
                election, either: (i) procure the rights to use that portion of the Services alleged to be infringing;
                (ii) replace the alleged infringing portion of the Services with a non-infringing alternative; (iii)
                modify the alleged infringing portion of the Services to make it non-infringing; or (iv) terminate the
                allegedly infringing portion of the Services or this Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>7.3 Process.</strong> The obligations under this Section 7 will apply only if the party seeking
                defense or indemnity: (a) gives the other party prompt written notice of the claim; (b) permits the
                other party to control the defense and settlement of the claim; and (c) reasonably cooperates with the
                other party (at the other party’s expense) in the defense and settlement of the claim. In no event will
                a party agree to any settlement of any claim that involves any commitment, other than the payment of
                money, without the written consent of the other party.

              <p>
                <strong>11.4 Governing Law. </strong> The Governing Laws, without reference to conflict of law rules,
                govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us. The United
                Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>11.5 Disputes. </strong> Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Services,
                or to any products or services sold or distributed by Aura Well USA will be adjudicated in the Governing
                Courts, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Governing Courts, subject to the
                additional provisions below. (a) The parties agree that the provisions of this Section 11.5(a) will
                apply. Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that either party
                may elect to proceed in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and
                federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. The arbitration will be conducted by the American
                Arbitration Association (AAA) under its commercial rules, which are available at www.adr.org or by
                calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the
                AAA commercial fee schedule. We and you agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted
                only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. We and you
                further agree that the underlying award in arbitration may be appealed pursuant to the AAA’s Optional
                Appellate Arbitration Rules. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we
                and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that you or
                we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

                regulations, including all such laws and regulations that apply to a U.S. company, such as the Export
                Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and economic sanctions
                programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. For clarity, you are solely responsible
